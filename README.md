## Abstract

In this paper, I address the ongoing epistemic and ethical crisis within contemporary academia, characterised by scholarly protectionism, epistemic gatekeeping, and institutional isolationism. I critically analyse traditional fiduciary frameworks and argue that they inadequately address the unique epistemic responsibilities of scholars, educators, and administrators. To rectify this shortcoming, I propose an Academic Hippocratic Oath integrating fiduciary duties (loyalty, care, accountability, non-maleficence) with epistemic virtues (humility, openness, justice, courage, compassion, transparency). Drawing on insights from fiduciary theory and virtue epistemology, as well as critical pedagogical perspectives, I offer a detailed blueprint for institutional adoption. I anticipate substantial cultural shifts toward epistemic humility, enhanced institutional accountability, and greater public trust as outcomes. While acknowledging implementation challenges, I recommend phased institutional trials and ongoing evaluation to ensure practical viability and continual refinement of the proposed fiduciary-epistemic framework.
